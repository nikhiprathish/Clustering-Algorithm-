This project successfully demonstrates the application of KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering on the Iris dataset, showcasing how unsupervised learning techniques can group data points based on patterns in their features.
KMeans Clustering efficiently identified compact and well-separated clusters, making it a practical choice for datasets with distinct groupings.
Hierarchical Clustering provided deeper insights into the relationships between data points, allowing for a detailed exploration of cluster hierarchies.
Through visualizations, it is evident that both methods effectively captured the natural groupings within the Iris dataset. This highlights the versatility and significance of clustering algorithms in exploratory data analysis and pattern discovery.
